## JetProject

#### Intro

This project simulates a fleet of different types of jets and displays a menu a user can choose from to use and access information about the jets.  Jets is input into an array and is able to perform various different tasks including having the user add jets to the list.

#### Technologies Used

* Java
* Constructors
* Methods
* Loops
* Objects

##### Lessons Learned

Approaching jets was a more difficult task then the prior project because we were using a plethora of technologies java has to offer and making everything tie together to obtain a working program.  In the process of struggling with certain aspects, making connections with different aspects in writing the program were made more clear how it all ties together.  That being from using getters and setters while working in abstract classes and working with constructors.  While, ending with a functioning program, there is a lot more to be learned to be able to make a far better program and understanding the functionalities of it all.
